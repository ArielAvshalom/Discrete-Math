# Cartesian Crosses

## Example Applications

They are useful in many aspects of programming, especially in conditional logic.

```python

for element_a in array_a:
    for element_b in array_b:
        print((element_a, element_b))
```

There are many other places where they exist, like graph theory, sql and so many other places!

## Clarifying a point from class

when crossing multiple sets, this is the formula:

&#8712;

:elem:  :in: :element: :epsilon:
\in\
\element\

```
Let A and B be sets
A x B = {(a,b) | a &#8712; A, b &#8712; B}
```
